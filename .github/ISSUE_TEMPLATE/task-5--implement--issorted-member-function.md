**Description**

Task 5 is to implement an `isSorted()` member function which will return
`true` if the `List` is currently sorted, and `false` if it is not.  This 
function should calculate its result dynamically, it should not rely on adding
or setting a new member variable that is set to try after `sort()` is called,
but instead checks pairs of items of the `List` to see if any are out of order,
and thus the list is not sorted.

We are really implementing the `isSorted()` method so we can improve the
API for our `search()` method somewhat.  Once `isSorted()` is working, create
a second (overloaded) version of the `search()` member method.  This method will
only take the `string` value to be searched for.  This method will first
check whether the list is sorted or not using your `isSorted()` function you
just wrote.  If the list is not sorted, it should first call `sort()` on
itself to sort the list, before calling the other `search()` that implements
the actual binary search.  You should of course perform a binary search on the
whole list of values.

**Suggested Solution**

To determine if a list is sorted or not, you can start by looking at
the first two values in index 0 and 1.  If they are out of order
(e.g. value in 0 is greater than the value in 1), then we can return
`false` immediately, the list is not sorted.  If they are in the
correct order, we can test indexes 1 and 2 to see if they are in
order, etc. and iterate through all adjacent pairs of values to see if
we find any out of order.  If we test all pairs and don't find any out
of order then the list is sorted.

**Additional Requirements**

- Be careful that you do not go past the end of your `values` array
  bounds when testing adjacent pairs of items to see if in order
  or not.  It is easy to access a value 1 beyond the end of the
  `values` array if you are not careful with your indexing.
